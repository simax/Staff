#Staff

### Getting started

During development

1. Make sure you're using the latest version from *github*
2. In the root Staff director. Run `./StartServer` on Mac. Just `StartServer` on windows
3. This should start a Mongo server (see the contents of StartServer.sh)
   Note: If EADDRINUSE error, check activity monitor to see if multiple sessions of node are running.
